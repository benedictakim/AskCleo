## User Story: Little Human
```
As a little human, so bored and not knowing what to do 
(I have already asked mommy but her ideas were so lame and she told me to stop bothering her and go Ask Cleo)
I want to go on my tablet and ask Cleo the Cat for suggestions on what to do
So that I can do an activity and not be bored
